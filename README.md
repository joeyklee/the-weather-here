# The Weather Here
> This is a little application that prompts you to "check-in". This application gets your location data then retrieves the weather for that location. On the server, the server queries the OpenAQ - open air quality - database for pollution data within 10km of the given coordinates. You can view your checkins and also a little "story" writted from the contextual data collected from the application. This includes data on the weather, your location, and the pollution in that area if measurements are available.
